During the project I decided to create the password generator from scratch, as I find it easier to accomplish and do that way as well as helps me learn more. 
Worked on the index.html first by decided the basic layout of the website and how I would like it to look.
Did googling for ideas and ways for brainstorming ideas of how I wish to layout
Finally found one that I would like to try and create myself, one that uses checkboxes instead of alerts.
It accomplishes the same purpose in a more neat manner and helps me learn a new way to do it while within my own time and practice the execution onto homework practice. While still performing the same goals!
Did research on how to implement check boxes and figured out how after about 4 different youtube tutorials.
Worked on the style.css to layout the grids, colors, and positioning with paddings and margins and etc...
Finally worked on the script.js with research help for incorporating the check boxes to work, as well as for the system I was going for. 
The tutorials I found helped me learn new things that I have not yet learned or had struggled to understand in class at the times.
Completed the script.js piece by piece to make the application work.
Went through the code and neated everything up with the help of some google tutorials to help make sure that the code would still work after neating the code up slightly.
Assignment complete.
Overall this assignment helped me learn more and expand my creative freedom. Although I did not use the base code and such that was given to us at the start of the assignment, I enjoy it more having creative freedom to create it from scratch my way. It helps me learn more and more that I would have struggled to learn in class by spending the time and slowly learning piece by piece. I still completed it with the same execution that was requested by the original piece, but with checkboxes instead of alerts as I know alerts very easily and well by now I wanted to challenge myself to something new.
